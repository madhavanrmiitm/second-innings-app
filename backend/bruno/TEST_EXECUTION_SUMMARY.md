## Detailed Test Analysis

### Successful Test Patterns

1. **Authentication Tests**: All Firebase token verification working correctly
2. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations all functional
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control working properly
4. **Error Handling**: Proper 404/403 responses for invalid requests
5. **Data Validation**: All input validation working as expected
6. **Response Format**: Consistent JSON response structure

### Performance Metrics

- **Average Response Time**: ~6ms per request
- **Fastest Test**: User profile retrieval (1ms)
