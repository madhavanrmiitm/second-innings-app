## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

**New to the project?** Follow this path:

1. **Start here**: **[DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md)** for the **preferred testing setup**
2. **Alternative setups**: [DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) or [LOCAL_SETUP.md](LOCAL_SETUP.md) if needed
3. **Learn the API**: [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for endpoint details
4. **Run tests**: Use the Bruno test suite to validate your setup

**Testing your setup:**
```bash
# Install Bruno CLI
npm install -g @usebruno/cli

# Run all tests
cd bruno/second-innings-backend
bru run --env Local

# Run specific module tests
bru run Admin --env Local
```

**Important**: The system includes a pre-configured admin account (`21f3001600@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) that's automatically created during database initialization, providing immediate administrative access and enabling full testing of admin endpoints.
